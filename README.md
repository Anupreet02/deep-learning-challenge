# deep-learning-challenge


* [ ] Overview

The objective of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting whether a charity funded by Alphabet Soup is likely to be successful. The model is built using the charity dataset, which contains various features related to each charity, and is used to classify charities as successful or not based on these features.

This project includes multiple steps:

* Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data.
* Model Training and Evaluation: Build and train a neural network model.

* Optimization: Refine the model to improve accuracy.
* Report: Summarize the performance of the model.

* [ ] Requirements

Dependencies

To run the code, you will need the following Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras.

* [ ] Steps

Step 1: Preprocess the Data

* Read the Data: Load the charity_data.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Target and Features: The target variable is whether a charity is successful or not, which is the column that we aim to predict.
* Drop Unnecessary Columns: Drop the EIN and NAME columns as they are not useful for prediction.
* Identify and Handle Categorical Data: Identify categorical variables and use pd.get_dummies() to encode them.
* If any categorical variables have more than 10 unique values, combine "rare" categories into a new value 'Other'.
* Scaling the Features: Use StandardScaler() from scikit-learn to scale the features.
* Split the Data: Split the data into training and testing datasets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.

Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

* Build the Neural Network: Create a neural network with an appropriate number of layers and neurons. Start with one or two hidden layers.
* Use ReLU as the activation function for hidden layers and Sigmoid for the output layer (for binary classification).
* Compile the Model: Use the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
* Train the Model: Train the model with the training data, using a validation split to track performance during training.
* Save the modelâ€™s weights every five epochs using a callback.
* Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the trained model on the test data to determine its loss and accuracy.
* Save the Model: Save the model to an HDF5 file named AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.

Step 3: Optimize the Model

* Adjust Hyperparameters: Experiment with adding more layers or neurons, adjusting the number of epochs, or trying different activation functions to improve performance.
* Handle Rare Categories: Revisit the handling of categorical variables to ensure rare categories are properly grouped.
* Evaluate and Save: After optimization, evaluate the model's performance and save the final optimized model as AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5.

Step 4: Report

* Neural Network Model Report: For this part of the project, we analyze the performance of the deep learning model created for the Alphabet Soup Charity dataset. The analysis includes the following sections:

Title: Neural Network Model for Alphabet Soup Charity Classification

1. Purpose of the Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to build a binary classification model using deep learning techniques to predict whether a charity will be successful based on features provided in the charity dataset. The successful prediction will help stakeholders in the Alphabet Soup initiative make informed decisions about which organizations to support. The model is evaluated based on accuracy, loss, and potential optimization efforts.

2. Results

a. Data Preprocessing

* Target Variable: The target variable for the model is whether the charity will be successful (IS_SUCCESSFUL).
* Feature Variables: The features for the model include factors such as the application type, income amount, category codes, and other relevant information.

* Dropped Variables: The EIN and NAME columns were removed as they were not useful in predicting the charity's success.

b. Model Architecture

Neurons and Layers:

* The model starts with one hidden layer consisting of 128 neurons, followed by a second hidden layer with 64 neurons.
* The activation function for the hidden layers is ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which is effective in handling non-linearity in the data.

* The output layer uses the Sigmoid activation function to produce binary predictions (0 or 1).

c. Model Performance

* The model was trained for 100 epochs with a validation split of 20%. During training, the model's loss and accuracy were monitored to avoid overfitting.
* The achieved accuracy on the test data was 72.7%, and the loss was 0.577, which indicates a reasonable performance for the initial model.

d. Model Optimization

* After evaluating the model, multiple attempts were made to increase the accuracy by adding layers, adjusting neurons, and experimenting with activation functions.
* The model's performance was slightly improved, reaching an accuracy of 73.0%.

3. Summary of Results

* The neural network model shows promising results with an accuracy of around 73%. While it didn't quite reach the 75% target, it provides a good foundation for further optimization.
* The model was able to effectively classify the data with reasonable accuracy, demonstrating that deep learning can be applied successfully to binary classification tasks.

4. Alternative Models

A random forest classifier or XGBoost could be used as an alternative approach to solve this problem. These models work well for classification tasks and are less prone to overfitting when tuned correctly. They would provide an interpretable set of rules and decision trees that might offer a different perspective than the neural network approach. Given that the dataset might contain both categorical and continuous variables, tree-based models could also handle the data better in some cases.

Conclusion

By following the steps outlined above, a deep learning model was created that predicts whether an Alphabet Soup-funded charity is likely to be successful. The process involved data preprocessing, model building, optimization, and reporting on the findings and model performance. Further optimization could yield higher accuracy, and alternative models such as random forests may provide a viable solution.
